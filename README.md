- **Discography**: A detailed list of Alcest's albums and their release dates.
- **Facts Section**: A table of interesting facts about the band, styled with CSS.

- **Location Pinning**: Users can submit their location via the form, which is then added to a shared map to highlight the global Alcest fan base.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes.
